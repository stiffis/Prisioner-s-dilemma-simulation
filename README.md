# Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation

This project is a simulation of the **Prisoner's Dilemma**, a classic problem in game theory that explores cooperation and conflict in decision-making. The simulation models scenarios where agents make decisions based on predefined strategies, aiming to study the outcomes of their interactions.
